<p>&quot;Boss,&quot; Heathcliff says, voice shaking. The targets have all been neutralised, their bodies scattered on the battlefield around them, a battlefield he doesn't recognise, doesn't remember being on, but that's not important when Hong Lu is—</p>
<p>His attempt to kneel down next to Hong Lu is more of a collapse, and the impact to his knees should hurt but right now he can't feel anything. With a shaking hand, he grabs Hong Lu's shoulder to roll him onto his back. His glove comes back stained red. Hong Lu's eyes are closed, but maybe it's—Hong Lu always comes back covered in blood, of course he does, he fights at close range with machetes. It doesn't have to mean—</p>
<p>In front of him, Hong Lu takes in a wet, gasping breath.</p>
<p>The world comes sharply back into focus. Heathcliff rips off his own jacket and jams it up against the wound to stanch the bleeding, and Hong Lu wheezes weakly in protest, but that's good, that means he's still feeling pain. That means it's not too late.</p>
<p>&quot;Hang on,&quot; Heathcliff says. &quot;Just hang on, Sinclair will be back in a mo', and then—&quot; <em>And then</em>, what? Do they have anything that would be able to help a wound this grim? Heathcliff doesn't know where Sinclair is, just knows that he isn't dead and isn't here, which must mean he's gone to get something to help. It must.</p>
<p>Hong Lu cracks open his eyes and clearly tries to look at Heathcliff, but his gaze seems distant and unfocused. When he exhales, it's uneven and burbling. Blood in his lungs, Heathcliff realises with alarm.</p>
<p>&quot;Heathcliff,&quot; a woman's voice says, and startled, Heathcliff looks up. A white haired woman stands on the other side of Hong Lu. She looks down at them dispassionately. Something about her tickles a hazy memory, but Heathcliff doesn't know her. &quot;Your emotional state is preventing the Mirror overlay from separating properly. You need to calm down.&quot;</p>
<p>Heathcliff doesn't know what that means, and he doesn't care. Doesn't she see that Hong Lu is dying? &quot;I need to help him,&quot; he insists.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; she says calmly, &quot;you need to—&quot;</p>
<p>Heathcliff stops listening and looks back down to Hong Lu, whose eyes have slipped shut again.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't fall asleep,&quot; Heathcliff says sharply, breath catching in his chest. He can't get a proper inhale in, and it feels a bit like drowning. &quot;Don't you dare. Open your eyes right now, you wanker.&quot;</p>
<p>Hong Lu's eyes stay closed, his pained expression slackening into something serene.</p>
<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; begs Heathcliff, voice cracking. His eyes sting with unshed and unwelcome tears. He can't cry—he has to fix this. &quot;Don't do this. Hong Lu, don't <em>do this</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>From some distance away, the woman from before starts talking quietly to someone else. &quot;Faust recommends you turn back the clock. This isn't...&quot;</p>

<div class="pg hidden">
 <p>"...an Identity that carries a high level of risk. We can work out what to do about the persistence on the way to our next location."</p>
<p>"&lt;Maybe we should give him a minute?&gt;"</p>
<p>"Vergilius is waiting for us." </p>
<p>"&lt;Ah... Alright, then.&gt;"</p>
</div>

<p>But underneath Heathcliff's blood soaked hands, Hong Lu isn't moving. Nothing else matters.</p>
<p>Heathcliff knows this is just what death is like, senseless and random and unpredictable. All you can do is keep going despite it all, until it comes for you. He knows this. He can't accept it.</p>
<p>Heathcliff is the replaceable one—Sinclair, even. Anyone can be taught to shoot a gun, but where would they be without Hong Lu? Even if they could somehow manage to get enough funding, neither he nor Sinclair can lead an office, find jobs, navigate the politics of the City. They'd be dead in the water. And Heathcliff—he knows where he'd be without Hong Lu. He'd still be sleeping in the streets, going from one shite mercenary job to the next. And that's assuming he hadn't already pissed off the wrong person and bled out in an alley.</p>
<p>Before Hong Lu had found him, had taken him in like some stray, he'd been living every day angry and short-sighted. He never thought about things like what he'd like to do tomorrow, or where they should go for dinner. Before he'd realised it, Hong Lu had made him think about the future.</p>
<p>Hong Lu can't be dead. Not on some nameless battlefield Heathcliff doesn't remember preparing for, not from some wound Heathcliff didn't see him get. This can't be happening. There has to be something he can do.</p>
<p>Heathcliff keeps pressing down on the wound, long past the point of any sense. Hong Lu may be still and cold with his blood spreading out across the hard concrete, but Heathcliff can't bring himself to think that this is the end.</p>
<p>Distantly, the throbbing pain in Heathcliff's knees disappear, but every part of him has already gone numb. It's beneath noticing. His subconscious stashes it away along with the chill in his white-knucled hands and the wet blood turning tacky under his fingernails.</p>
<p>Hong Lu's chest shifts, and Heathcliff is sure it's just his own arms giving out on him. But then, impossibly, Hong Lu's eyes open and snap to his, making direct and piercing eye contact. Heathcliff's breath catches in his chest, torn between uncertainty and sheer relief.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Heathcliff,&quot; Hong Lu says, and his smile is a little more vacant than normal, but he almost <em>died</em> just now so Heathcliff isn't about to hold it against him. &quot;Is there—&quot;</p>
<p>He doesn't finish, because Heathcliff surges forwards to scoop up Hong Lu's torso and squeeze him so tightly against his chest that it's hard to breathe. &quot;Oh thank fuck,&quot; he gasps out, vision going misty with more tears he struggles to hold back. &quot;Don't do that to me, you wanker.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Um,&quot; says Hong Lu. &quot;My apologies.&quot; A moment later, he pats Heathcliff awkwardly on the back.</p>

<div class="pg hidden">
<p>"Who wants to go get them?" </p>
<p>"Sounds like you just volunteered, Gregor babe." </p>
<p>"No, thanks. I'd rather not get in the middle of whatever that is." </p>
</div>

<p>&quot;You were dead,&quot; Heathcliff says, and he doesn't want to say it, doesn't even want to think it, but that doesn't make it less true. &quot;You were—you stopped breathing.&quot; He doesn't understand how any of this is happening. If he weren't holding on so tightly to Hong Lu, his hands would be shaking.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, that's probably true,&quot; Hong Lu says amiably, not sounding the least bit concerned.</p>
<p>Hong Lu is nonchalant about a lot of barmy things, but dying shouldn't be one of them. Heathcliff pulls back, gripping Hong Lu by the shoulders and just barely holding himself back from shaking the other man. He can't shake someone who had a gaping hole in his chest not five seconds ago.</p>

<div class="pg hidden">
  <p>&quot;Will he... be okay? Should we separate them?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I mean, Heathcliff wouldn't hurt him, right? It's probably fine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In this state, it is uncertain what Heathcliff may or may not do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I suspect Heathcliff would react poorly to any attempted interference.&quot;</p>

</div>

<p>&quot;You were <em>dead</em>,&quot; he stresses, willing Hong Lu to take his own health seriously for once in his life.</p>


<div class="pg hidden">
<p>&quot;That is precisely why we should step in. Executive Manager, you need only say the word.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aww, come on~ let them have a moment. Heath must be close to him, right? Or, the other him.&quot;</p>
</div>


<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Hong Lu agrees again, but he's looking Heathcliff over carefully. A moment later, Hong Lu reaches up and carefully touches his cheek. &quot;I'm alright. Are you alright?&quot;</p>
<p>Heathcliff would be reeling back if he weren't already so flummoxed.</p>
<p>&quot;Um,&quot; he says. &quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Hong Lu repeats, fingers spreading out to properly cup Heathcliff's cheek and curl softly at his jaw, leveling him with a clear-eyed, unblinking stare. Heat flares at the back of Heathcliff's neck, spreading quickly to his ears.</p>


<div class="pg hidden">
  <p>&quot;Hey... Do you think they'll kiss?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;That is <strong>highly</strong> inappropriate!&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Forsooth, their comradery shant be tainted by trivial matters of the flesh!&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;But Donqui, what if it deepens their, ah, chivalric bond?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh?! W-well. Ahem. When you put it that way, w-who would we be to come between such a heartfelt display?!&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;It'd be hilarious, right?&quot;</p>
  </div>
  

<p>Even past the strange behavior, this is wrong. There is no concern in Hong Lu's eyes. His expression is blank and slightly calculating, like Heathcliff is one of their targets. But they're both out of bullets and Hong Lu's machetes were lodged in some body halfway across the field. Had Hong Lu got a head wound after all?</p>
<p>&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Heathcliff says desperately as his grip on Hong Lu's shoulders tightens, trying not to let the strange, prickling newness of Hong Lu's bare skin against his own distract him. &quot;You're the one who—&quot; He looks down at the chest wound that had killed Hong Lu, only to find it missing, and Hong Lu in a white shirt and red tie instead of his usual dark greys.</p>

<div class="pg hidden">
  <p>&quot;&lt;We really should intervene... Shouldn't we? That's not the Hong Lu he thinks it is.&gt;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I know, isn't it exciting? Do you think it counts as cheating on the other Hong Lu?&quot;</p>
</div>


<p>Heathcliff looks up, unsure what to think, and is again taken aback when he notices something missing from the side of Hong Lu's face. The earpiece is gone. Of course, Hong Lu could have easily lost his earpiece in the fray of the mission, but Heathcliff is sure he just had it. Didn't he?</p>
<p>Then something just behind Hong Lu's shoulder catches his eye.</p>
<p>&quot;What happened to your hair?&quot; he blurts out, because the clothes and the wound and the earpiece are one thing, but Hong Lu couldn't have just grown a metre of hair in the last five minutes.</p>


<div class="pg hidden">
  <p>&quot;This has gone too far, fraternization between employees is clearly improper. Executive Manager, I shall take measures to resolve this!&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;&lt;Wait, hold on, it looks like it might be resolving itself?&gt;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;...As you wish, Executive Manager. I shall stay my hand.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>It is at that moment—holding Hong Lu with both arms, fresh tears still drying on his face, and Hong Lu's soft hand on his cheek—that Heathcliff snaps back to awareness.</p>

<div class="pg hidden">
  <p>&quot;Aww~ I liked Heath with long hair. The suit wasn't half bad either.</p>
<p>It is convenient that intervenion was not necessary. However, the overlay should not have lasted as long as it did. Faust will look into it.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;&lt;Yeah, that's probably for the best. This could have gone a lot worse.&gt;&quot;</p>
  </div>

<p>&quot;Uh,&quot; he says, no longer sure why he's kneeling on the hard, blood-covered ground, crouching over Hong Lu of all people.</p>
<p>Hong Lu smiles politely, waiting for Heathcliff to work it out.</p>
<p>They'd been sent out by Dante. They'd fought something or other. They must've won, because they were still alive and the things they'd been fighting weren't. Which meant the fight was over, and they all should have gone back to normal, like always.</p>

<div class="pg hidden">
  <p>&quot;Now that the matter is resolved, Dante, we must get moving.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;&lt;Yeah, but...&gt;&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;It is heartening to espy that such brotherly bonds transcend universes!&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;'Brotherly', huh?&quot;</p>
  </div>

<p>As always, memories from the other Identity are fuzzy. He thinks maybe he'd seen one of theirs collapsed, and gone to check on them. On Hong Lu? That must be right.</p>
<p>He vaguely remembers Faust saying something about getting his emotions under control, and equally vaguely remembers blowing her off, because Hong Lu had been hurt. That had mattered to him, for whatever reason. And then Hong Lu had been dead, which had mattered more. And later, Hong Lu hadn't been dead anymore, and he'd been... relieved? And he'd—</p>
<p>Heathcliff feels the back of his neck go hot, feeling like a daft twat.</p>
<p>&quot;Oi,&quot; he says to Hong Lu, not sure if he's about to give Hong Lu a bullocking for not setting him straight, or apologise for being a tosser.</p>
<p>But before he can say anything else, from some distance away, someone calls,  &quot;Are you gonna kiss?&quot;</p>
<p>Heathcliff's head snaps up, horrified to realise they've had an audience this entire time. Rodya, because of course it was Rodya, meets his eyes unapologetically and grins.</p>
<p>Heathcliff scowls. &quot;Sod off!&quot; he yells back.</p>
<p>&quot;We could kiss if you'd like, Heathcliff,&quot; Hong Lu says pleasantly. And apparently, given the chorus of <em>ohh</em>s in the distance, loud enough that their onlookers heard him.</p>
<p>Heathcliff smothers his initial reaction, which is to kick Hong Lu's head in. Sure, Clockhead could fix him up again, and it would shut their audience right up. But Heathcliff's guts are still tight and twisted up from seeing Hong Lu dead on the ground.</p>
<p>The intimate knowledge of Hong Lu's micro expressions is already fading, but Heathcliff can still read the calculated, blank smile enough to know Hong Lu is treating him like an outsider. He hates it, or maybe it's the residual memory of the other version of him who hates it. Maybe in five minutes, an hour, a week, he won't care anymore.</p>
<p>But right now, regardless of how humiliating it feels, he does care.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; Heathcliff says firmly. &quot;Sorry I grabbed you, mate. Wasn't myself there for a minute.&quot;</p>
<p>He finally lets go of Hong Lu, surprised to find his fingers stiff and a little sore. It must be from how tightly he'd been gripping Hong Lu. As casually as he can, Heathcliff stands, brushes himself off, and, after a short eternity of nearly dying from the embarrassment of what he's about to do, holds out his hand to Hong Lu. Hong Lu stares at him for what feels like an equally long eternity. But with the last of the fading residual knowledge, Heathcliff knows it's because, for whatever reason, Hong Lu thinks the offer is a trick. So he keeps holding out his hand, and he waits.</p>
<p>After another long moment, Hong Lu takes his hand. And Heathcliff helps him up.</p>
