<!-- <p>this is a sentence about <span class="en">teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">taeoh</span>.</p> -->

<p><span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> opens his mouth to ask if he did something to piss <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> off, when <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> steps towards him and loops an arm around his back. <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span>'s voice dies in his throat. <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> constricts the hold and <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> stumbles towards him, and suddenly, they're so close they're nearly pressed together.</p>
<p><span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> can't hear anything over the blood rushing in his ears, but <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> smells warm and clean with a hint of something almost floral—his shampoo. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<body>

<p><span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> is in Classroom 1-5.</p>
<p><span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> is here, and so is <span class="en">Eugene</span><span class="hidden kr">Juntae</span>. <span class="en">Rowan</span><span class="hidden kr">Juyang</span> isn't, so maybe that's why <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> came. To look for <span class="en">Rowan</span><span class="hidden kr">Juyang</span>. That must be. Why else would <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> be in <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span>'s class?</p>
<p><span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> says, &quot;<span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span>,&quot; authoritatively, and a strange thrill prickles at the back of <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span>'s skull.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah?&quot; <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> says, trying to sound like he doesn't care.</p>
<p><span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> looks at him, impassive and cold as always. &quot;Come here,&quot; he says, and <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> does. But then he says, &quot;Get on your knees.&quot;</p>
<p>They're in school. Also, <span class="en">Eugene</span><span class="hidden kr">Juntae</span> is right there.</p>
<p>&quot;<span class="en">Eugene</span><span class="hidden kr">Juntae</span> isn't here,&quot; <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> says, and <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> finds that he's right. The whole classroom is empty, in fact, except for the two of them.</p>
<p>So <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> gets on his knees.</p>
<p>&quot;Now what?&quot; asks <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span>.</p>
<p>Shouldn't that be <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span>'s line? &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you want to do while you're down there?&quot; <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> shifts his legs open suggestively.</p>
<p><span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> feels hot all over. &quot;How should I know? You're the one who told me to be down here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I did,&quot; agrees <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span>. &quot;So why don't you make it worth my while?&quot;</p>
<p>That doesn't really make sense, but he's already on the ground. So <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> shuffles forward because that's what <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> wants.</p>
<p>Once he's between <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span>'s legs, he puts his hands on <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span>'s thighs and leans in. He nuzzles at the inseam of <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span>'s pants, inhaling deeply and finding it hard to catch his breath. His whole body is hot and feverish. <span class="en">Ben</span><span class="hidden kr">Humin</span>eath his cheek, a hardness is forming. He opens his mouth</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>his alarm goes off.</p>
<hr> 
<p>In class that day, <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> finds it even harder than normal to pay attention to the teacher. A dozen different times he almost gets up to ditch, too jittery to stay still in his seat. If he got out of here, he could take a long walk, or better yet, find someone to get in a fight with. That would help, he's sure of it—get him out of his head. Work off some pent-up energy or something.</p>
<p>During the first break, <span class="en">Rowan</span><span class="hidden kr">Juyang</span> gets up. When <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> stays seated, <span class="en">Rowan</span><span class="hidden kr">Juyang</span> gives him a confused look.</p>
<p>&quot;Dude, aren't you coming?&quot; Like he always does during breaks, he's going over to Class 1-5 to hang out with <span class="en">Eugene</span><span class="hidden kr">Juntae</span>—and, by extension, <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span>.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm busy,&quot; says <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span>, not looking him in the eye.</p>
<p>&quot;Busy doing what? S'not like you'll study for the quiz we have later.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait,&quot; <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> says, head snapping up. &quot;We have a quiz?&quot;</p>
<p><span class="en">Rowan</span><span class="hidden kr">Juyang</span> rolls his eyes. &quot;See? Anyway, come over if you want to hang out.&quot;</p>
<p>He leaves. <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span>, for the first time all day, is resolutely glued to his seat.</p>
<p><span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> declines all invitations to Class 1-5 for the rest of the day and moves from his desk only once—during lunch, to eat on the roof by himself. During the last break of the day, <span class="en">Rowan</span><span class="hidden kr">Juyang</span> turns to him with a serious look.</p>
<p>&quot;Is something going on?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...No,&quot; <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> says, but he can feel himself making a face.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh. Do you... wanna talk about it?&quot; <span class="en">Rowan</span><span class="hidden kr">Juyang</span> doesn't sound like he wants to talk about it. <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> doesn't really want to talk about it either. Except... maybe he does? No, he doesn't. He really, really doesn't.</p>
<p>Then again, maybe— &quot;Do you ever have weird dreams?&quot; he blurts out, and immediately regrets it.</p>
<p>&quot;Weird dreams?&quot; <span class="en">Rowan</span><span class="hidden kr">Juyang</span> echoes. &quot;What kind of weird dreams? Sometimes I dream I'm still in Australia, and when I wake up in my bedroom, I think I'm in the wrong place. Or... sometimes I dream my mom is the weather lady.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, not like that,&quot; <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> says, running his hand through his bangs roughly. &quot;Like—where you do something you'd never do in real life.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, all the time.&quot;</p>
<p>This is a little relieving to hear, actually. &quot;Really?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, sure. Like the other day, I had this dream where I was in swim trunks and a feather boa, and—&quot; His jaw snaps shut and his face goes bright red. &quot;Actually, never mind, let's not talk about that one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? Come on, that's not fair! That's just you wearing weird clothes, not doing weird things.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It just <em>starts</em> with the weird clothes,&quot; <span class="en">Rowan</span><span class="hidden kr">Juyang</span> explains. &quot;But then I'll like, go to the Sydney Opera House and give a dance performance for a bunch of celebrities. And if they don't clap loudly enough, then I swallow the entire ocean.&quot; From the expression on his face, destroying the seafood economy like that upsets him. Or maybe it's the celebrities not clapping. &quot;I can't even dance, man.&quot;</p>
<p>They ponder on that quietly for a moment, because <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> can't really dance either, but he's never had any dreams about it. He has had dreams about being really strong and beating up some famous fighter, like Donghyun Kim. But if he could really do that, he would, so it's probably not the same.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyway,&quot; <span class="en">Rowan</span><span class="hidden kr">Juyang</span> says, clearing his voice and making an obvious effort to sit taller. &quot;Dreams don't mean shit, man. It's all cool.&quot;</p>
<p>Actually, yeah. That's right. Suddenly, <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> feels better about everything. Dreams don't mean shit.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> is in Classroom 1-5 again, and <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> is the only one there because <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> is the only person in that class who matters.</p>
<p><span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> says, &quot;<span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span>, come here,&quot; and <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> comes.</p>
<p><span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span>'s on his knees before he remembers being there, and <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> towers over him, even though he'd been sitting down a moment ago. The chairs and desks are gone, and it's just them in the too-wide classroom.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't move,&quot; <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> orders.</p>
<p>&quot;I won't,&quot; <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> assures him, but then <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span>'s shoe is pressing into his erection and he squirms.</p>
<p>&quot;I said not to move,&quot; <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> says coldly.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry,&quot; he gasps out, &quot;I'm sorry.&quot; He tries to do better, to hold more still, but it's hard. It hurts—or maybe it doesn't hurt? Maybe it feels good? Or maybe it hurts <em>and</em> feels good. It's hard to tell. He could ask <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> to stop so he could figure it out, but he doesn't want to.</p>
<p><span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> presses harder, and <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> might make a noise but it might just be in his head. Then <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> isn't wearing any shoes, and it's just his bare foot over the erection straining in <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span>'s underwear. It's gross. Or maybe it's not gross? He wants <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> to touch him properly, or at least to move his foot a little, but he doesn't dare ask. He's close, even though <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> has barely done anything.</p>
<p>&quot;<span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span>,&quot; <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> says, breathing the word right in <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span>'s ear, and <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> shudders and</p>
<p>he</p>
<p>blinks his eyes open to his bedroom ceiling. It's morning. A moment later, his alarm goes off and he reaches over to swipe away the app closed.</p>
<p>Before he makes it even halfway to his phone, he freezes. The movement has brought to his attention the mortifying and uncomfortably sticky situation in his underwear.</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<hr>
<p>At lunch the next day, after agonizing over it all morning, <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> brings <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> a Coke and puts it on his desk.</p>
<p>&quot;What's that for?&quot; <span class="en">Eugene</span><span class="hidden kr">Juntae</span> asks.</p>
<p>&quot;Shut up,&quot; <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> snaps, finding it easier to look at <span class="en">Eugene</span><span class="hidden kr">Juntae</span> than at <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span>. &quot;It's not for anything.&quot;</p>
<p><span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> risks a glance over, watching <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> stare at the Coke pensively for a long moment. He nearly jumps out of his skin when <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> looks up and their eyes meet.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks,&quot; <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> says simply.</p>
<p>His attention makes <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span>'s skin tingle and his neck hot. &quot;It's whatever,&quot; <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> mumbles.</p>
<p>Dreams don't mean shit, but <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> still feels awkwardly guilty.</p>
<hr>
<p>After class lets out, <span class="en">Rowan</span><span class="hidden kr">Juyang</span>, <span class="en">Eugene</span><span class="hidden kr">Juntae</span>, and <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> have cram school. <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> has business on that side of town, and he's also determined to act normally from now on, so he tags along with them. It's not weird. It's just like always.</p>
<p><span class="en">Rowan</span><span class="hidden kr">Juyang</span> was right, and <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> feels better than he has in days. Dreams really don't mean shit. He doesn't have to pay attention to them or feel weird about them. He can just pretend they never happened. That way, everything's fine.</p>
<p><span class="en">Rowan</span><span class="hidden kr">Juyang</span> and <span class="en">Eugene</span><span class="hidden kr">Juntae</span> are talking about Shuttle Patch Rankings again. <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> has largely checked out, but <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> is kind of interested. Apparently, some guy from Hyeongshin has been beefing with another guy from Ganghak. Seems like no one's sure if it's Union-sanctioned or if it'll even amount to anything, but the forums have been debating who would win anyway. The guy from Hyeongshin is the crowd favorite, should it actually come to blows, but apparently a shuttle from Ganghak has been arguing in the forums all afternoon and has actually managed to sway some opinions.</p>
<p>Then <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> looks over at <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> sharply, and <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> immediately loses track of the conversation. He bristles under the unexpected and intense focus. He's been really careful not to stare at <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> lately, so what's his problem? Everything's fine, isn't it? <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> swears he hasn't been acting weird.</p>
<p><span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> opens his mouth to ask if he did something to piss <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> off, when <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> steps towards him and loops an arm around his back. <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span>'s voice dies in his throat. <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> constricts the hold and <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> stumbles towards him, and suddenly, they're so close they're nearly pressed together.</p>
<p><span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> can't hear anything over the blood rushing in his ears, but <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> smells warm and clean with a hint of something almost floral—his shampoo. Nothing about this moment feels real, like time itself has stopped. Maybe he's dreaming again.</p>
<p>Not that he ever felt this acutely rattled in his dreams.</p>
<p>A second later, something large speeds past behind <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span>'s back, kicking up a gust of wind and heat and coming entirely too close. <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> is still staring at <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span>'s face, dumbfounded, but <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> is looking in the direction of whatever it was with his brow furrowed. His arm is warm around <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span>'s waist.</p>
<p>&quot;He almost hit you,&quot; <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> says. &quot;Asshole.&quot;</p>
<p><span class="en">Eugene</span><span class="hidden kr">Juntae</span> comes in close, looking worried. &quot;<span class="en">Jeez, a</span><span class="hidden kr">A</span>re you okay?&quot; He looks like he wants to check them over for injuries, his hands hovering in the air awkwardly. But he must think better about touching either of them, and he instead grips the straps of his backpack like he's strangling them. &quot;<span class="en">T</span><span class="hidden kr">Aish, t</span>hose delivery drivers shouldn't even be allowed on sidewalks.&quot;</p>
<p><span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> barely processes the words and couldn't begin to respond.</p>
<p><span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> steps back, arm sliding away, and the others start walking again, <span class="en">Eugene</span><span class="hidden kr">Juntae</span> and <span class="en">Rowan</span><span class="hidden kr">Juyang</span> going back to their Shuttle Patch conversation. <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> is the only one to notice <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> isn't following. He stops, tilting his head and stares at <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> without saying a word, and <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> mentally slaps himself, taking a step forward to rejoin the group.</p>
<p>He's fine, he tells himself, heart hammering in his chest for reasons having nothing to do with mopeds and reckless driving on sidewalks. Everything is totally fine.</p>
<hr> 
<p>That evening, <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> lies in bed and stares at the ceiling and doesn't close his eyes. He can't dream if he doesn't sleep, and he's decided to never dream again. Easy. Simple. How hard can it be?</p>
<p>He manages maybe twenty minutes before his eyes are sliding closed and he's drifting off. But he shakes himself awake and stares hard at the ceiling again. He does fall asleep a few times, but each time is short and fitful.</p>
<p>By the time his alarm goes off, <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> feels a mixture of relief and dread. Going to school while he's this exhausted is going to suck, but at least he didn't have any dreams.</p>
<hr> 
<p><span class="en">Rowan</span><span class="hidden kr">Juyang</span> tells him he looks like shit, but in a concerned way, and <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> has already decided to avoid Class 1-5 for a few days, but that cements his decision.</p>
<p>It'll just be until he feels normal again. What's normal? Who knows. He'll know it when he gets there.</p>
<p><span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> tries not sleeping that night as well, but it goes much worse since he's more tired. No weird dreams bother him though, so after that, he starts letting himself sleep like normal. It's fine. He doesn't have any dreams at all, and even if he did, dreams don't mean shit.</p>
<p>The day after that, he trails behind <span class="en">Rowan</span><span class="hidden kr">Juyang</span> when he goes to visit Class 1-5 during break. It's all cool. He doesn't know what he was worried about. He's probably just not getting enough sleep and it's been messing with his head.</p>
<p>So on Friday, when <span class="en">Ben</span><span class="hidden kr">Humin</span>'s crew goes to Ttosikki Chicken and he's invited, he agrees to go.</p>
<p>The whole crew is there, except for <span class="en">Gogo</span><span class="hidden kr">Gotak</span>. They order a bunch of chicken, and it's delicious as always, but <span class="en">Ben</span><span class="hidden kr">Baku</span> isn't eating as quickly as usual. He keeps pausing between bites to check his phone.</p>
<p>At some point, <span class="en">Ben</span><span class="hidden kr">Humin</span>'s phone goes off. He answers it without even swallowing the food in his mouth. He says something to the person on the other end, barely intelligible over all the chicken. Then, phone still pressed to his ear, he's standing up and waving to them and mouthing, <em>See you tomorrow</em>.</p>
<p>When <span class="en">Ben</span><span class="hidden kr">Humin</span> doesn't finish his chicken, it's serious. Even <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> knows that. Should they get ready for a fight? <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> would know—should <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> ask?</p>
<p><span class="en">Rowan</span><span class="hidden kr">Juyang</span>, however, doesn't know <span class="en">Ben</span><span class="hidden kr">Humin</span> or Alex well enough to understand how unusual it is for <span class="en">Ben</span><span class="hidden kr">Humin</span> to leave any food on his plate.</p>
<p>&quot;They should just get married already,&quot; <span class="en">Rowan</span><span class="hidden kr">Juyang</span> complains. <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> looks up sharply. <span class="en">Rowan</span><span class="hidden kr">Juyang</span> goes pale. &quot;Not that I'm prejudiced against that kind of thing,&quot; he says quickly. &quot;It's just, you know. They're so obsessed with each other. I'm not sure they'd even have time for a girlfriend with how much they hang out. But like, it's totally fine. Whatever makes them happy.&quot;</p>
<p><span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> looks like he has something to say to that also, but <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> beats him to the punch.</p>
<p>&quot;You're not against that kind of thing?&quot; <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> says numbly.</p>
<p>The whole table seems to freeze at the same time, and everyone stops what they're doing to look at him. <span class="en">Rowan</span><span class="hidden kr">Juyang</span> is gaping, <span class="en">Eugene</span><span class="hidden kr">Juntae</span> looks worried, and though Gerard is inscrutable with his overgrown mop of hair covering half his face, his focus is fully on <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span>. Even <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> is looking at him.</p>
<p>The undue attention makes <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> prickle with self-consciousness and the need to explain himself. &quot;Isn't it, like, gross?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> says, his tone so sharp it could cut <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span>'s head off. &quot;It's not.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> says dumbly, shirking under <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span>'s glare and winded like he's just been punched in the gut. He wants to slide underneath the table and for the earth to open up and swallow him whole. Is <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> mad at him? He doesn't want <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> to be mad at him. But he started this, and he's never known how to stay down when he's losing. &quot;I mean. It's just...&quot; He pulls his hands under the table because they're going to start shaking any second now, and he can't let anyone see. &quot;...Are you sure?&quot; he asks weakly, eyes trained on the table rather than risk looking at anyone.</p>
<p><span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> doesn't hesitate for even a second. &quot;It's not gross at all. It's completely fine.&quot; He doesn't sound harsh anymore, just firm. But <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span>'s hands have started to shake just like he knew they would and he still can't look up.</p>
<p>There's a light touch to his shoulder. From the direction it came from, he knows it's <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span>.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span>?&quot; <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> says. &quot;It's fine.&quot;</p>
<p>It doesn't feel fine. It feels a little like he's dying, actually. He doesn't want to be feeling like this—weak and small and stupid—in front of people he respects.</p>
<p>But <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> pushes down the lump in his throat and nods. <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> squeezes his shoulder before pulling away. The other people at the table change the subject, and no one brings it up again.</p>
<hr>
<p><span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> has another dream that night. He wakes up well before both the sun and his alarm, and the details are quickly evaporating. Still, he knows <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span> was there, and he knows he's hard now.</p>
<p>He doesn't like it. He kind of hates it, actually.</p>
<p>But he closes his eyes and slides his hand into his boxers and replays the half-remembered echo of <span class="en">Gray</span><span class="hidden kr">Sieun</span>'s voice saying, <em>Come here, <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span></em>.</p>
<p>Maybe it's fine. Maybe it's not. <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> doesn't really know, and he doesn't particularly want to think about it. Since he's up anyway, he gets ready early and swings by the convenience store on his way to school.</p>
<p>At the convenience store, <span class="en">Teddy</span><span class="hidden kr">Taeoh</span> buys as many Cokes as will fit into one bag.</p>
<p>He takes them all straight to Class 1-5.</p>
