kyoshika-talk,,,"More importantly!"
kyoshika-talk,,,"Did you have a dream about kissing me, Sir Takumi?!"
,takumi-talk,pov-open,"I, uh..."
kyoshika-talk,,,"Then we're bound by fate! It's as simple as that. "
,takumi-talk,pov-open,"Well..."
tsubasa-talk,,,"Huh?! Did you really have a dream about HER?!"
kurara-talk,,,"WHAT?! That can't be right, you must have been dreaming about me! "
,takumi-base,thought,"This is so embarrassing. I wish I could just disappear... But they won't believe me if I try to back out now. "
,takumi-base,thought,"Nothing good can come from me admitting I kissed all three of them in my dreams. It might be better to say I dreamed about someone else. "
,takumi-talk,pov-open,"Um... Well..."
,takumi-talk,pov-open,"I had a dream about kissing..."
,takumi-base,thought,"I can't just say anyone. I should think about this carefully. "
,takumi-base,thought,"[choices]"
,takumi-base,thought,"Nozomi"
,takumi-base,thought,"Momo"
,takumi-base,thought,"Hiruko"
,takumi-base,thought,"Kako"
,takumi-base,thought,"I really don't think of her that way. I don't want to give her the wrong idea, or make her uncomfortable."
,takumi-base,thought,"Momo might actually break me in half. Definitely not worth it. "
,takumi-base,thought,"I could say Hiruko but... "
,takumi-base,thought,"Just thinking about it makes my head hurt really badly for some reason. Maybe because she was with me when we fell off the roof? "
,takumi-base,thought,"Whatever it is, something is telling me I should pick someone else. "
,takumi-base,thought,"Kako... "
,takumi-base,thought,"If Ima ever found out I said anything about kissing her, falling off a roof would be the least of my problems..."
,takumi-base,thought,"Wait, doesn't that mean there's only guys left?!"
kurara-talk,,,"Well?! We're waiting!!"
,takumi-talk,pov-open,"Um...! "
,takumi-base,thought,"Ugh...! "
,takumi-base,thought,"Maybe I should say someone so ridiculous they have to drop it. "
,takumi-base,thought,"Who should I say...!?"
