More importantly!
Did you have a dream about kissing me, Sir Takumi?!

<takumi>
I, uh...

<kyoshika>
Then we're bound by fate! It's as simple as that. 

<takumi>
Well...

<tsubasa>
Huh?! Did you really have a dream about HER?!

<kurara>
WHAT?! That can't be right, you must have been dreaming about me! 

<thought>
This is so embarrassing. I wish I could just disappear... But they won't believe me if I try to back out now. 
Nothing good can come from me admitting I kissed all three of them in my dreams. It might be better to say I dreamed about someone else. 

<takumi>
Um... Well...
I had a dream about kissing...

<thought>
I can't just say anyone. I should think about this carefully. 

[choices]
Nozomi
Momo
Hiruko
Kako

I really don't think of her that way. I don't want to give her the wrong idea, or make her uncomfortable.

Momo might actually break me in half. Definitely not worth it. 

I could say Hiruko but... 
Just thinking about it makes my head hurt really badly for some reason. Maybe because she was with me when we fell off the roof? 
Whatever it is, something is telling me I should pick someone else. 

Kako... 
If Ima ever found out I said anything about kissing her, falling off a roof would be the least of my problems...

Wait, doesn't that mean there's only guys left?!

<kurara>
Well?! We're waiting!!

<takumi>
Um...! 

<thought>
Ugh...! 
Maybe I should say someone so ridiculous they have to drop it. 
Who should I say...!?
