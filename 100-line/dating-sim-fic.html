<!-- notes: 
-  "thoughts" does not require pov-open or target2 etc, but is coded to kill the stuff around it if its there. thoughts would ONLY require pov-open if the first thing takumi does upon arriving to a scene is "thoughts", as pov-open brings takumi-box to display:flex. (but the current behavior of takumi-box is to stay open forever once open)
- script says thought, code says thoughts. python parser accounts for that but just making a note here anyway. 
- narration DOES exist but i dont think its every used? test during a black room ig

 <!-- an: 

  there is no going back. there is only forward!! i initially wanted to have a log like the game does, but it would literally double the word count (and also be a ton of effort to try and code). 

  pot;
  for the first choice menu: it's a. little broken. maybe go in order,,, 

  i have no CGs and as such when the screen goes black i need you to just picture a CG in your mind's eye. work with me here. i didnt have time to also learn art on top of this.
