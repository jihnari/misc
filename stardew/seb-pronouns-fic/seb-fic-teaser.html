  <p>Standing at the door with a hand on the knob is the farmer. <span class="personal upper"></span><span class="hide">She</span> stares at them despondently. They stare blankly back.</p>
  <p>Sebastian recovers first. &quot;Oh, hey. Uh. What's up?&quot;</p>
  <p>The farmer takes this as an invitation and comes into the room, coming to a stop once <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span>'s standing in front of them.</p>
  <p>&quot;Um,&quot; says Sebastian at the same time Sam says, &quot;What.&quot; They both stop speaking when the farmer pulls out something shiny from <span class="possessive"></span><span class="hide">her</span> pocket and holds it out towards Sebastian. It's a rock. A Frozen Tear.</p>
  <p>When he realizes what it is, Sebastian says, &quot;Oh!&quot; and reaches out to take it. <span class="farmer-upper"></span><span class="hide">She</span> drops it in his hand. &quot;Thank you.&quot;</p>
  <p><span class="farmer-upper"></span><span class="hide">She</span> gives him a thumbs up, and as almost an after-thought, waves at Sam. Sam says, &quot;Uh, yeah, hi?&quot;</p>
  <p>Then <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span> turns around and leaves, not closing the door behind <span class="object"></span><span class="hide">her</span>. Sebastian, used to that, gets up to close it just in case anyone from Sam's family comes back home and is annoyed by the noise. When he turns back around, ready to get back to practice, Sam is staring at him.</p>
  <p>Sebastian stares back. &quot;...What?&quot;</p>
  <p>Sam raises both eyebrows.</p>
  <p>Sebastian scowls. &quot;<em>What</em>?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;You know what.&quot; Sebastian raises his eyebrows to mirror Sam's, and Sam groans. &quot;Dude. Don't pretend you don't know. What was that? With the,&quot; —Sam gestures at the closed door— &quot;And&quot; —He gestures at Sebastian— &quot;Whatever that was.&quot;</p>
  <p>Sebastian feels his face get warm but pretends he doesn't. &quot;It's no big deal. <span class="personal upper"></span><span class="hide">She</span> just... does that sometimes.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;<span class="personal upper"></span><span class="hide">She</span> just casually has a precise and psychic knowledge of where you are at all times and shows up to <em>hand you a rock</em>?&quot;</p>
  <p>When Sam puts it like that it does sound weird, but that's just because Sam doesn't know <span class="farmer"></span><span class="hide">her</span>. Sebastian has stopped wondering how it is exactly that <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span> seems to know exactly where everyone is without asking.</p>
  <p>&quot;It's not always a rock,&quot; Sebastian says instead of confronting the psychic thing. &quot;Sometimes it's like—sashimi or whatever.&quot;</p>
  <p>Sam's expression becomes deeply confused. &quot;Where is <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span> getting—you know what? Nevermind, I don't care. Can we go back to practicing now?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Sure,&quot; says Sebastian with some relief.</p>
  
  
  <hr/>
  <p>The week passes slowly. Sebastian gets a decent sized project from one of his regular clients and that keeps him busy, but the project isn't particularly interesting. He doesn't see the farmer every day, but he does most days. Usually, when he takes his smoke break for the evening, <span class="farmer"></span><span class="hide">she</span>'s already out at the lake fishing.</p>
  <p>For a farmer, <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span> seems to do an awful lot of fishing. But what does Sebastian know? He's just a freelance coder without a college degree living in his mother's basement. He doesn't actually have to worry about things like making enough money to feed himself.</p>
  <p>Sometimes they chat in between fish-catches, but sometimes the farmer just nods at him and he nods back, and it's nice. A peaceful comradery between two quiet people.</p>
  <p><span class="farmer-upper"></span><span class="hide">She</span> also gives Sebastian a quartz, and later, a carrot. The carrot is new, but Sebastian likes them well enough. He takes the gifts and says thank you, and the farmer nods, or sometimes smiles. Sebastian starts to wonder if he should be looking into return gifts, but he wouldn't know where to start. Maybe some seeds from Pierre? Or, maybe a scarecrow? Would that be too lame? They haven't known each other long enough for Sebastian to guess at what the farmer might like, outside of... farming stuff. <span class="hide">Maybe she'd like jewelery. Would that be weird of him? If he got her a necklace or something, would she think that was inappropriate, something only a boyfriend would be allowed to give her?</span> He thinks about asking his mom, but the idea makes him cringe. Instead of getting anything, he just keeps on going as he has been.</p>
  <p>So just like always, when Friday rolls around, he's at the saloon with Sam and Abigail. He and Sam are playing their weekly game of pool, and Abigail is hanging out on her regular couch while she nurses a beer and makes idle commentary. Sometimes the commentary is about their game, sometimes it's just about whatever thought crosses her mind. She's on a Marxism kick again, and Sebastian can't say he hates it.</p>
  <p>And then the farmer walks in. Sebastian spots <span class="object"></span><span class="hide">her</span> first, but only because Abigail is mid rant and distracted, and Sam is facing away from the door. Sebastian gives <span class="object"></span><span class="hide">her</span> a &quot;sup&quot; nod, and <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span> &quot;sup&quot;s back.</p>
  <p>Sebastian watches as <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span> loops around the main room to talk to Leah and a few of the other Friday regulars, and is unsurprised when the loop turns <span class="object"></span><span class="hide">her</span> back towards the pool room. They make eye contact and Sebastian, who had been about to take a shot, pauses and straightens.</p>
  <p>Sam gives him a funny look and opens his mouth to say something, but then the farmer comes around the table and into his field of vision and his mouth snaps shut. The farmer makes a beeline for Sebastian and holds out <span class="possessive"></span><span class="hide">her</span> hand, something small and glittering in <span class="object"></span><span class="hide">her</span> palm. Sebastian smiles and picks it up, closing his own hand around the hard edges. &quot;Thanks,&quot; he says. And because that doesn't feel like enough, he adds, &quot;I really like these,&quot; even though <span class="farmer"></span><span class="hide">she</span> already knows that. <span class="farmer-upper"></span><span class="hide">She</span> smiles back, turns to wave at Sam (who mostly looks resigned and waves back), and leaves the bar.</p>
  <p>Sebastian pockets the Frozen Tear, then leans over to line up his shot again.</p>
  <p>From behind him, Abigail says, &quot;What was that?&quot;</p>
  <p>Sebastian ignores her and takes the shot. The cue ball strikes the striped 9 ball, sending it flying towards the far corner pocket, and meanwhile the cue ball's path deviates due to the collision, spiraling towards the 10, as planned. The white ball hits the 10 and nudges it away from the solid 3, which is one of Sam's balls and wouldn't give him any points, but doesn't manage to hit it into a pocket. That's fine, because the 9 goes in without a fuss, so his turn continues. Instead of going after the 10, he sets up another shot to move one of his balls in the path of one of Sam's. No balls go into any pockets, but he doesn't want Sam to have to sit there while he finishes the game all by himself. When he straightens, he sees Sam rolling his eyes. For a blissful, ignorant moment, he thinks it's about how he just set Sam up for failure.</p>
  <p>But no.</p>
  <p>&quot;<span class="personal upper"></span><span class="hide">She</span> just 'does that sometimes',&quot; Sam says sarcastically, making quote marks with his fingers and everything. Sebastian scowls but doesn't deny it. He just made two really good shots. Can't they talk about that?</p>
  <p>&quot;Your turn,&quot; he reminds Sam loudly, not so subtly trying to get them both to drop it.</p>
  <p>&quot;<span class="personal upper"></span><span class="hide">She</span> just <em>does that</em>?&quot; Abigail echoes. &quot;Hey—was that a trash can lid on <span class="possessive"></span><span class="hide">her</span> head?&quot;</p>
  <p>Sebastian turns and glares at her. &quot;What, so it's illegal to wear hats now?&quot;</p>
  <p>Abigail stares at him, eyes wide. Sebastian stares back, hard and challenging. Abigail blinks.</p>
  <p>&quot;Sebastian,&quot; she says carefully, and he thinks he's about to get chewed out for snapping at her because she hardly ever says his full name, and he's already feeling guilty about his tone but he hates it when people talk badly about literally one of his favorite people on the planet. But then she follows up with, &quot;<span class="gay">What the fuck? Are you into him</span><span class="hide">Are you <em>dating the farmer</em></span>?&quot; Sam makes a choking sound.</p>
  <p>Sebastian feels himself flush and his heart beats too loud in his ears. &quot;It's not like that.&quot; It might actually be a little like that<span class="gay">. Sebastian hasn't let himself think about it too deeply for fear of an identity crisis, but he might be... a little bit into the farmer. Or, well, a lot. But he's never dated anyone, much less someone from outside of Pelican Town, and</span><span class="hide">, but</span> he's not actually sure how city people do the whole dating thing. TV makes it look a lot more casual than it is in the valley, and Sebastian doesn't want to bring up the local tradition involving a bouquet because he doesn't want to come off as a desperate loser who can't handle ambiguity. <span class="gay">Especially when he's not even sure if that's what's happening between them.</span></p>
  <p>&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; Abigail says judgmentally. &quot;Because you <em>always</em> go out of your way to defend complete weirdos who think trash cans count as fashion. Seriously, Seb?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;<span class="gay">Who cares?" Sam complains. "Can we get back to me losing at pool?</span><span class="hide">Can we get back to me losing at pool?&quot; Sam says. &quot;</hide>That was way more fun than whatever this conversation is.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Yes, please, let's do that,&quot; Sebastian says quickly.</p>
  <p>Sam leans over the pool table and pretends to calculate the angles, hits the cue ball, and they both watch it bounce off the cushions twice and miss every single other ball on the table.</p>
  <p>&quot;Nice,&quot; he tells Sam, mostly meaning how he didn't pocket the cue ball on accident like he so often does. &quot;You almost hit something that time.&quot;</p>
  <p>As he angles his cue stick to take his next turn, he can feel Abigail's narrowed eyes boring into the back of his neck. But he ignores it and so does Sam, and Abigail sighs.</p>
  <p>&quot;Fine, then. Dad says the bookseller is coming into town tomorrow—&quot;</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>On Sunday morning, Sebastian wakes up, rolls onto his back, and stares at the ceiling. He should get up. But if he did, then what?</p>
  <p>He sets his own hours for his freelance work. At first, he'd just done the jobs as they came in, regardless of when. But the unpredictability made him moody and anxious. So after a few months after he'd started decided to arrange it like a &quot;normal&quot; work schedule so he could feel... normal. He only works on Monday through Friday (assuming he even has enough work for all five days of the week), and if he has anything left over on Friday, he leaves it for Monday, just like he would at a &quot;real&quot; job.</p>
  <p>It was good for him, for a while. It made him feel productive and anchored, and he liked being synced up with the rest of the world. Leaving Saturdays and Sundays open made him feel adult, and gave him something to look forward to during his self-imposed &quot;work week&quot;.</p>
  <p>He's not sure what happened. After a while, sleeping in on the weekends didn't make him feel relaxed or refreshed, it just made him feel like a piece of crap. What kind of adult was he, sleeping in until past 10 AM? And he wasn't even sleeping, he was just laying here, doing nothing. So, he should get up and do something.</p>
  <p>Except, he only wants to get up and do something for the sake of not feeling guilty. There's nothing he actually wants to do, he just wants to lessen the guilt about not doing it.</p>
  <p>That continues to be the state of things when someone knocks on his door and doesn't wait for his answer before opening it. It could be his mom, but the visitor doesn't immediately say anything, which is how he knows it isn't. There's a soft padding of footsteps getting louder as the farmer makes <span class="possessive"></span><span class="hide">her</span> way from the doorway to his bedside, and once <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span>'s looming over Sebastian, Sebastian makes himself glance over. But it's too hard to keep eye contact, and his gaze slides back up towards the ceiling.</p>
  <p><span class="farmer-upper"></span><span class="hide">She</span> rustles through <span class="possessive"></span><span class="hide">her</span> backpack wordlessly, and Sebastian opens his stupid, pathetic mouth and says, &quot;If I just disappeared, would it really matter?&quot;</p>
  <p>The rustling sound stops. Sebastian is too much of a coward to look over and see how his self-depreciating words have been recieved. Humiliatingly, his eyes start to sting and he feels the telltale pinpricks of tears. He stares resolutely up at the ceiling and doesn't blink, willing his eyes to dry themselves out so <span class="farmer"></span><span class="hide">she</span> won't notice. <span class="hide">Crying would be so incredibly uncool of him. She already knows he's a loser but that's no reason to go out of his way to shove it in her face.</span></p>
  <p>Something touches his forearm and he's startled out of his thoughts enough that he looks down. It's the farmer's hand, and <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span> grabs Sebastian's arm and tugs on it.</p>
  <p>&quot;Um?&quot; Sebastian says.</p>
  <p><span class="farmer-upper"></span><span class="hide">She</span> tugs on it again, more insistently, and when he looks up he finds <span class="farmer"></span><span class="hide">her</span> expression is hard with determination. So he sits up and lets himself be pulled out of bed.</p>
  <p><span class="farmer-upper"></span><span class="hide">She</span> pulls him to his desk, stops, and points down. &quot;Shoes,&quot; <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span> says, and Sebastian looks down and his shoes are there. So he slips them on.</p>
  <p>Then <span class="farmer"></span><span class="hide">she</span> takes him up the stairs and past his mom at the front desk without a single glance. His mom looks at the pair of them, eyes a little wide and bewildered. Sebastian gives her a helpless shrug on his way out the front door, and then a gust of crisp autumn air hits his bare neck. He should have grabbed a coat.</p>
  <p>Wait, crap, he's still in his pajamas.</p>
  <p>&quot;Hey,&quot; he says to the farmer, but he's summarily ignored.</p>
  <p><span class="farmer-upper"></span><span class="hide">She</span> walks down the path and Sebastian helplessly walks along with <span class="object"></span><span class="hide">her</span>. They aren't holding hands, but if anyone saw them, that's what it would look like.</p>
  <p><span class="gay">He's not sure how he feels about that, about looking like he's holding hands with a guy. It makes his skin feel prickly, like he's on the edge of a panic attack. But a larger part of him</span><span class="hide">He</span> hopes someone sees them.</p>
  <p>They don't stop until they hit the riverbank. Sebastian looks out at the water, the sun glinting off the surface in a way that almost hurts his eyes, and wonders what they're doing here. Before he can ask, the farmer takes out <span class="possessive"></span><span class="hide">her</span> fishing pole. Then holds it out to Sebastian.</p>
  <p>Conditioned as he is to not question the things he's handed, he takes it.</p>
  <p>&quot;Uh,&quot; he says, holding the fishing rod out awkwardly in front of him. &quot;What am I doing with this?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;We're fishing,&quot; <span class="farmer"></span><span class="hide">she</span> says patiently.</p>
  <p>&quot;I don't know how to fish.&quot;</p>
  <p>The farmer doesn't sigh like <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span>'s annoyed or take the fishing pole back. Instead, <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span> starts introducing the different parts of the fishing pole—the rod, the handle, the reel, the bobber, the hook. The box where <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span> keeps the bait. <span class="personal upper"></span><span class="hide">She</span> shows him how to be careful about the hook while casting, then holds his hands and guides him through a cast. <span class="hide">Her hands are soft and warm and Sebastian becomes immediately worried about his own hands, dry because he never puts on lotion, and probably cold. <br/><br/></span> The line hits the water and the bobber follows with a small splash, disappearing under the surface for a moment before floating back up.</p>
  <p>&quot;Okay,&quot; Sebastian says nervously, partially because his hands are starting to sweat and any moment now <span class="farmer"></span><span class="hide">she</span>'s going to notice and get grossed out, but mostly because Sebastian still doesn't understand what's going on. &quot;Now what?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;We wait,&quot; <span class="farmer"></span><span class="hide">she</span> says. Then <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span> finally releases Sebastian entirely, stepping back and sitting down on the grass.</p>
  <p>Sebastian looks at <span class="object"></span><span class="hide">her</span>, and <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span>'s looking out at the water so Sebastian lets himself stare a little. The way the morning light hits <span class="possessive"></span><span class="hide">her</span> hair and face makes <span class="object"></span><span class="hide">her</span> look iridescent, like some kind of angel. How is it that someone like that is willing to hang out with someone like him? <span class="hide">In the city, she probably had all sorts of choices. She's so pretty, men would have been falling over themselves to date her. She's probably dated all sorts of guys—tall guys with abs and great hair and real jobs. Guys with cars and money and maybe even summer houses. How is Sebastian supposed to measure up to that? He's not. </span></p>
  <p>&quot;If you look away you'll lose the fish,&quot; <span class="farmer"></span><span class="hide">she</span> says idly, without even moving <span class="possessive"></span><span class="hide">her</span> head.</p>
  <p>Sebastian flushes and turns his eyes back towards the bobber. &quot;I'm not going to catch anything,&quot; he grumbles, because it's true.</p>
  <p>&quot;Not if you keep looking away, you won't.&quot;</p>
  <p>So Sebastian reluctantly fixes his gaze on the completely stagnant ducky bobber.</p>
  <p>After a few silent minutes of the bobber doing, as he predicted, nothing, he asks the question he's been wondering since he was dragged out of bed that morning. Or, if he's being honest, maybe longer than that.</p>
  <p>&quot;What are we doing here?&quot;</p>
  <p><span class="farmer-upper"></span><span class="hide">She</span> doesn't answer for a long time, but it feels like <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span>'s thinking about <span class="possessive"></span><span class="hide">her</span> words rather than just ignoring him. So Sebastian waits.</p>
  <p>He's not sure what he expects. Maybe for <span class="farmer"></span><span class="hide">her</span> to put whatever is going on between them into words—make it real. Or for <span class="farmer"></span><span class="hide">her</span> to know exactly what he's been thinking the last few months and
  Or maybe for <span class="farmer"></span><span class="hide">her</span> to tell him more about fishing, because honestly who knows right now.</p>
  <p>But instead <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span> says, &quot;I did tech work, before I came here,&quot; and Sebastian almost drops the fishing pole. &quot;Had a good salary. A nice apartment. Hated... everything.&quot;</p>
  <p>Sebastian feels stunned into silence. But even if he could physically say something, he wouldn't know what that something might be.</p>
  <p>The farmer plucks a blade of grass from the earth and fiddles with it, shredding it into thin long strips along its seam. At length, <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span> continues. &quot;For a long time, it felt inevitable. Like everything in my life had led up to that point and there was nothing I could do about it. But—if you keep looking down you'll never notice what's in front of you.</p>
  <p>&quot;Sometimes,&quot; <span class="farmer"></span><span class="hide">she</span> starts, then pauses. <span class="personal upper"></span><span class="hide">She</span> reaches out for another blade of grass, changes <span class="possessive"></span><span class="hide">her</span> mind, and puts <span class="possessive"></span><span class="hide">her</span> hand in <span class="possessive"></span><span class="hide">her</span> lap. &quot;You just have to try something new. Even if it's scary. Even if you don't know what you're doing. You don't have to know what you're doing. You just have to face forward and try.&quot;</p>
  <p>Sebastian, who's staring at <span class="farmer"></span><span class="hide">her</span> hands and <span class="possessive"></span><span class="hide">her</span> resolute gaze out on the lake, swallows thickly and looks away, back in the direction his line is cast.</p>
  <p>A lot of things he spends a lot of time not thinking about come flooding to the surface all at once. What is he doing with his own life? Will he still be living in his mother's basement in five years? In ten? Will he ever manage to be self-sufficient when he doesn't even have a college degree? Even if he managed to make it out of this town, even if he somehow managed to get enough money—would he be able to survive on his own?</p>
  <p>Sebastian tries to think of what to say, but his throat feels swollen and he's afraid his voice would come out funny. His eyes are oddly hot. But because he's looking forward, he sees the small plastic duck quiver, then dip down below the surface.</p>
  <p>&quot;Hey,&quot; Sebastian says frantically, voice cracking just like he feared it would. &quot;Hey, the pole, I—?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Reel it!&quot; the farmer says urgently. &quot;Right hand, the handle, spin it clockwise!&quot;</p>
  <p>He does, and the farmer leaps up to grab the rod just above his hands and angle it upwards. He keeps reeling and <span class="farmer"></span><span class="hide">she</span> keeps angling the rod this way and that—and a second after the bobber reappears, so does a fish.</p>
  <p>An entire fish, its body a green so dark that it looks like it's covered in moss, wet and shiny in the bright sunlight as it twists angrily at the end of the line.</p>
  <p>&quot;Bullhead,&quot; says the farmer. &quot;Nice.&quot;</p>
  <p>Sebastian doesn't know what that means. &quot;I—caught it?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span> confirms.</p>
  <p>&quot;That's insane,&quot; Sebastian says incredulously. &quot;That's—you can just—<em>catch</em> fish?&quot;</p>
  <p><span class="farmer-upper"></span><span class="hide">She</span> laughs. It lightens up <span class="possessive"></span><span class="hide">her</span> whole face and makes Sebastian's heart skip a beat. The farmer is cute when <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span> smiles, but if Sebastian lets himself think about that for too long he's pretty sure he'll combust.</p>
  <p>&quot;Did you think I spent all that time fishing just to look cool?&quot; <span class="farmer"></span><span class="hide">she</span> asks, still laughing.</p>
  <p>Sebastian had maybe, possibly, secretly hoped <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span>'d done it to have an excuse to talk to him. At the moment, he can't recall seeing <span class="object"></span><span class="hide">her</span> ever catch anything.</p>
  <p>&quot;Here,&quot; <span class="farmer"></span><span class="hide">she</span> says, grabbing the line—and then the fish. With <span class="possessive"></span><span class="hide">her</span> bare hands. &quot;I'll clean it for you.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;You'll... what?&quot; Sebastian says, but <span class="farmer"></span><span class="hide">she</span>'s already pulled a knife out from somewhere and sliced a line down the belly of the olive green fish. Then <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span> digs it in <em>further</em>, and Sebastian has to look away, gagging.</p>
  <p>&quot;How do you think all that sashimi I give you is made?&quot; <span class="farmer"></span><span class="hide">she</span> teases, but it's lighthearted. &quot;Guess you'll still need me for something... Okay, done. You can look.&quot;</p>
  <p>Sebastian does, and not only is the knife gone, so is the fish. The farmer hands him a plastic bag. Out of habit, he takes it.</p>
  <p>&quot;See you tomorrow,&quot; <span class="farmer"></span><span class="hide">she</span> says, and then wanders off in the direction of the mines.</p>
  <p>Sebastian glances in the bag, and of course it's the fish. But the head and tail are missing, and it's cut in the same way he's seen fish at JojaMart.</p>
  <p>The walk home takes no time at all, with how deep in thought he is. When he pushes open the front door, his mother's voice startles him back to reality.</p>
  <p>&quot;Did you have a good time with the farmer <span class="gay">boy</span><span class="hide">girl</span>?&quot; she asks. It feels a little condescending, like when he was ten years old and she'd walk him home from playing at Sam's house.</p>
  <p>But Sebastian is so off kilter that his regular indignation doesn't rise up at the perceived offense, and he finds himself answering honestly.</p> 
  <p>&quot;Yeah. Yeah, I did.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I'm glad.&quot; She smiles at him, then glances down with a questioning look. Sebastian follows her gaze, sees the bag, and remembers the fish.</p>
  <p>&quot;Hey, mom,&quot; he says, &quot;do you already have plans for lunch?&quot;</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>It's Wednesday, and Abigail still won't shut up about the farmer.</p>
  <p>&quot;Where did <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span> even get it?&quot; Abigail complains while she uses Sebastian's extra computer to play Junimo Kart. &quot;Whose can is it from? Or did <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span> buy it special, just to use as a hat? Can you even buy just the trash can lid?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I think it might be the mayor's,&quot; Sam says idly. Sam had wanted to play Solarion Chronicles but Abigail hates that game, so he's just flipping through a comic book Sebastian's pretty sure he's already read. &quot;It was missing last time I passed by his house. I thought it had just fallen behind the can, but maybe it's a hat now.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh, well, in that case. At least it went to a better home.&quot;</p>
  <p>Sam hums in agreement.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, Sebastian is magnanimously ignoring both of them in favor of digging through his bookshelf, searching his many board games for inspiration and calculating which he might be able to convince Abigail to try. In a lot of ways, it's easier when she's not around. She's so particular about what she will and won't do, while Sam's up for just about anything. But in other ways, it's nice to have her because then Sam has someone else to bounce off of.</p>
  <p>At the moment, Sebastian kind of wishes neither of them were here. But if he keeps ignoring them, they'll eventually get bored and move the topic along. Hopefully.</p>
  <p>His hope is in vain.</p>
  <p>&quot;Is <span class="possessive"></span><span class="hide">her</span> farm even, like, farmable? What about all the trees and rocks?&quot; Abigail muses.</p>
  <p>&quot;I dunno,&quot; Sam says, the shrug evident in his tone. &quot;I haven't been out there.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Me neither, but it's not like we ever talk. I only ever see <span class="object"></span><span class="hide">her</span> when <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span> comes to buy seeds from dad—and when <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span>'s giving rocks to Seb. I mean, what's that even about?&quot; she complains. &quot;I swear, <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span> is so weird. <span class="personal upper"></span><span class="hide">She</span> should get a life and stop hanging around our Seb.&quot;</p>
  <p>Sebastian's stomach drops, and he clenches the board game box in his hand so tightly that it caves in. <span class="hide">He hopes she never says anything like that to the farmer. The way Abigail phrases it would give her the wrong idea. They're not dating, Abigail has no claim over him. But the farmer wouldn't know that.</span></p>
  <p>But before he even has time to think how to respond to her, to piece together exactly why he's so upset, Sam sighs heavily. &quot;What's <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span> ever done to you? <span class="personal upper"></span><span class="hide">She</span>'s never been rude to anyone. Yeah, <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span>'s weird, but who isn't?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Seriously?&quot; Abigail says, annoyed. &quot;I thought we were on the same side, here.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I'm not on anyone's side,&quot; argues Sam. &quot;...But also <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span> gives me Joja Cola sometimes.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;And the truth comes out,&quot; says Abigail, but her tone is back to joking. &quot;I don't <em>hate</em> <span class="object"></span><span class="hide">her</span>. <span class="personal upper"></span><span class="hide">She</span>'s... fine.&quot; She sighs. &quot;I just don't get why <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span> keeps hanging around Sebastian. It's not like they're <em>dating</em> or something.&quot;</p>
  <p>Sebastian is frozen solid, struck by a myriad of swirling, tumultuous emotions.<span class="hide"> He's never had a girlfriend and he knows that's his own hang-up and that it has nothing to do with Abigail, but he hates how lightly she's is treating it. Is he pathetic for thinking he might be able to have more if he really, earnestly tries? Is he delusional for thinking someone might want to date him?</span> <span class="gay">Abigail doesn't have any say with who he hangs out with—or who he dates. He knows she's just joking but suddenly, he wants to set her straight. He wants to tell her exactly how he feels about the farmer so she can't make fun of it anymore.</span></p>
  <p>Sam makes a noncommittal noise like he might disagree but also doesn't want to die on the hill that is Sebastian's love life. Sebastian feels his hackles rise and looks over his shoulder at Sam.</p>
  <p>Sam's response doesn't go unnoticed by Abigail, either. &quot;What, you think they <em>are</em> dating or something?&quot; she asks sarcastically.</p>
  <p>Sam looks up from his comic, eyes wide with the realization of the trap he'd set up for himself and then walked into. He looks at Abigail, then Sebastian, and finds no sympathy in either. <span class="gay"><em>What the hell, dude?</em> Sebastian tries to project silently with his glare. <em>Crap, bro, I'm sorry,</em> Sam's look says back, and he looks petrified.</span> &quot;Uh. I mean, well. No, but—&quot;</p>
  <p>Sebastian cuts Sam off, before he can dig himself an even deeper hole. He doesn't really feel like saying anything but he also feels like he should set the record straight. It's not fair the farmer isn't even in the room and getting all this flack. <span class="gay">But when he goes to say the words, he finds his mouth oddly dry. We're not—dating. But I'm... I..." He has to swallow hard before he can continue, but he finds himself hesitating. </span><span class="hide">&quot;We're not dating. I told you that already. But I...&quot; He hesitates. How does he say this without coming off like an even bigger loser than he is already?</span> Both Sam and Abigail are staring at him, stunned silent. For Abigail's part, she looks like she'd forgotten he was even there. Sebastian can feel his face turning red and he looks down at his hands so he doesn't have to look at them, but he wants to say it. &quot;I do. Like <span class="object"></span><span class="hide">her</span>. But we're not dating.&quot; Probably not, anyway. He doesn't know if 'just friends' go to the river together to fish and have overly deep conversations about their lives, but he's done worrying about it.</p>
  <p>At his friends' continued silence, Sebastian looks up nervously to gauge their reactions. Abigail looks shell-shocked and Sam's expression is pinched, like he's uncomfortable. Which is a bit annoying, since <em>they'd</em> been the ones to bring it up and ask.</p>
  <p>&quot;Um. Congrats?&quot; says Sam when he notices Sebastian looking. &quot;I mean, not congrats? I'm not sure. I hope it...&quot; He glances nervously at Abigail, then back. &quot;Works out?&quot;</p>
  <p>Sebastian shrugs awkwardly. &quot;It'll be fine. I mean, I don't know if it'll work out. But it's whatever.&quot;</p>
  <p>He looks back at his pile of board games and shuffles them around, trying to look invested in the meaningless action.</p>
  <p>After several long, awkward moments, Abigail finally speaks up. &quot;We're... happy for you,&quot; she says, but she sounds strangled. &quot;I mean, we will be. Assuming it goes somewhere.&quot; She pauses, and Sam stays quiet, and Sebastian has nothing more to say. Then, musingly, Abigail says, &quot;<span class="personal upper"></span><span class="hide">She</span>'s not the worst person you could have picked. At least it's not, I don't know, <span class="gay">Clint</span><span class="hide">Pam</span></em>.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;What? Ew! <em>What</em>?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I'm just saying, it could be worse.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;<em><span class="gay">Clint</span><span class="hide">Pam</span></em>?&quot; Sebastian says desperately, unable to put together a full sentence and just putting all of his incredulity and betrayal into his tone. &quot;<span class="upper personal"></span><span class="hide">She</span>'s—&quot; <span class="gay">An asshole</span><span class="hide">Penny's mom</span>, for one. &quot;—<em>old</em>.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;<span class="upper personal"></span><span class="hide">She</span>'s not <em>that</em> old,&quot; Sam says. &quot;I could see it.&quot;</p>
  <p>Sebastian glares at him, scandalized, and Abigail says, &quot;Ew? Seriously?&quot;</p>
  <p>Sam glares back at both of them, defensively. &quot;I'm just saying! Sebastian, even if you were crushing on <span class="gay">Clint</span><span class="hide">Pam</span>, we'd still love you.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;I mean,&quot; says Abigail.</p>
  <p>Sam throws his comic at her, and both Sebastian and Abigail say <em>&quot;Hey!</em>&quot; at the same time.</p>
  <p>&quot;Be careful with that,&quot; Sebastian scolds Sam.</p>
  <p>&quot;I'll buy you a new one if it's bent,&quot; says Sam, but it's with half his attention as he glares unwaveringly at Abigail.</p>
  <p>The standoff lasts for five long, nearly intolerable seconds before Abigail huffs. &quot;Fine, yes, we'd still love you or whatever.&quot; Then she mutters, &quot;Probably get you an intervention, though.&quot;</p>
  <p>Sebastian mulls that over and decides it's probably appropriate. If he were crushing on <span class="gay">Clint</span><span class="hide">Pam</span> and also <em>telling people about it</em>, he'd deserve an intervention.</p>
  <p>Sam, satisfied, gets up to retrieve the book and brush it off, then returns to his green chair. He starts reading the book again, as if the last five minutes never happened.</p>
  <p>Sebastian looks over at Abigail, who's looking at Sam with an expression split between annoyance and fondness. When she moves her gaze away, it's towards Sebastian. They stare at each other for a long moment, and that moment would have been tense before Sam's comments and book throwing.</p>
  <p>At length, Abigail says, &quot;But you're...&quot; then trails off. The struggle for the right word is evident on her face. &quot;...Okay?&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; says Sebastian honestly. &quot;I am.&quot;</p>
  <p>He's not dating the farmer and he's fine with that. <span class="gay">He's not even sure he's ready for something like that, with—with a guy. Not that he doesn't want to, it's just... For now, h</span><span class="hide">H</span>e's not going to push for anything more, but he's not going to shy away from it anymore either.</p>
  <p>He likes <span class="farmer"></span><span class="hide">her</span>. <span class="farmer-upper"></span><span class="hide">She</span> gives him rocks. Yeah, it's kind of weird, but that's fine. It's enough for him.</p>
  <p>&quot;Hey, wanna play Catan?&quot; he asks, pitching his tone up so Sam knows he's included in the question.</p>
  <p>Abigail sighs. &quot;Ugh, fine, at least that one isn't too long.&quot;</p>
  <p>&quot;Oh my god, yes, finally,&quot; Sam says.</p>
  <p>So Sebastian brings the box over to the table.</p>
  <hr/>
  <p>It's Monday. Sebastian is at his desk, working.</p>
  <p>There's a knock at the door and it swings open a second later. Sebastian says, &quot;Hey,&quot; without looking away from his screen, because he knows it's the farmer. &quot;Just give me a minute to finish this up.&quot;</p>
  <p><span class="farmer-upper"></span><span class="hide">She</span> comes to stand next to him, waiting silently. He finishes typing the block of code he was working on, leaves a note about the function call he has to write in the next line, and then hits the save shortcut on his keyboard.</p>
  <p>He turns his chair towards <span class="object"></span><span class="hide">her</span> and smiles. &quot;What's up?&quot;</p>
  <p>Just seeing <span class="object"></span><span class="hide">her</span> makes Sebastian happy. His life is still at a shit standstill with his circumstances, but maybe it won't always be that way. Just yesterday he got a bid he would have normally passed on because it involved a database software he wasn't familiar with, and he took it. Because what the hell, why not? He can learn Redis.</p>
  <p>And in the meantime, he'll keep receiving rocks and sashimi gratefully, and maybe he'll actually get around to figuring out what kind of thing would make a decent gift in return, and they'll keep hanging out on the river bank—and that's enough for him. He's not going to ruin anything by being impatient or insecure. But he can't keep standing still, either. He can't keep looking down and ignoring everything around him.</p>
  <p>He's fine with things the way they are.</p>
  <p>Except then the farmer pulls a bouquet out of <span class="possessive"></span><span class="hide">her</span> backpack, a full, pristine bouquet–miraculously, somehow not crumpled or flat from being shoved inside a bag–and holds it out to him. Dumbstruck, Sebastian takes it. He stares down at the bundle of multi-colored flowers in his hands, uncomprehending. This… can't be what he thinks it is. Not when it's a weird old Pelican Town tradition, and the farmer hasn't even been here a year. Sebastian is jumping to conclusions.</p>
  <p>He looks up only to find the farmer looking at him expectantly.</p>
  <p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; he says automatically. The farmer keeps staring, unblinking.</p>
  <p>Oh. Is he—<em>not</em> jumping to conclusions?</p>
  <p>&quot;If this is–I mean, if you're serious–&quot; <span class="farmer-upper"></span><span class="hide">She</span> just keeps staring and it's making him even more nervous. &quot;I am also serious. I mean–&quot; Sebastian stops talking. He swallows, and feels a bit like he might throw up. Finally, he whispers, &quot;Are you sure?&quot;</p>
  <p>He's not entirely sure what he's asking, but he can barely fathom how someone might like him enough to want to be with him. As more than friends. But here they are, in Sebastian's room, with a bouquet he suspects was bought from Pierce's shop for the express purpose of giving to him.</p>
  <p>Sebastian doesn't want to insult <span class="farmer"></span><span class="hide">her</span> by asking if <span class="personal"></span><span class="hide">she</span> knows what the bouquet means, but he also desperately wants to make sure he's not misinterpreting anything.</p>
  <p>But the farmer doesn't look confused at his vague question, doesn't seem put off by his stumbling words. <span class="personal upper"></span><span class="hide">She</span> just says, &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
  <p>Oh. Okay, then. They're... really doing this? &quot;Oh, okay, cool,&quot; Sebastian says, like an absolute loser. He tries to salvage it. &quot;Great.&quot; Well, that didn't work. He gives up on being cool, or even remotely normal about this. &quot;I'm–I'm really happy. It's just—I've never done anything like this before, <span class="gay">especially not with—" A guy, he doesn't say. No one needs to know exactly how many sleepless nights he spent wondering if he'd really be okay with this if it ever happened, especially not now, at the moment when it's really happening. He's going to be cool about this. "But</span><span class="hide">but</span> I—really want to? With you.&quot;</p>
  <p><span class="farmer-upper"></span><span class="hide">She</span> takes a step forward and leans down to embrace him, still seated in his office chair, crushing the flowers between them. It's a brief, squeezing contact, during which Sebastian's face goes hot and his brain blue-screens. 
    <p><span class="hide">She's smaller than him when they're both standing but now his cheek bumps against her clavical as she pulls him close. He wants to hold her back but he's holding the flowers, and also his arms are more or less pinned into place. She's soft and warm and he'd thought her hair would smell like flowers but instead it smells like sunshine and grass.</span><span class="gay">The farmer is a bit taller than him when they're both standing, but now Sebastian feels possitively engulfed. Sebastian's nose bumps up against the farmers chest, and Sebastian feels securely bracketed by his frame—assuming someone can feel secure and delerious levels of flushed at the same time, anyway. He smells like grass and clean sweat and Sebastian can only hope he smells half as good.</span><p>
    Then <span class="farmer"></span><span class="hide">she</span> steps back. Gives him a thumbs up. And leaves the room. Sebastian doesn't think he was imagining the pink tint on <span class="possessive"></span><span class="hide">her</span> face.</p>
  <p>For the first time, Sebastian thinks maybe neither of them quite know what they're doing. Maybe no one does. But that's okay. They just have to keep looking forward, and take it one day at a time. Together.</p>
  <p>As Sebastian puts the bouquet down on the desk space next to his computer and turns back to his work, he feels light. Sure, he can always learn new coding concepts or languages, he can keep pushing himself to be a better coder.</p>
  <p>But now, he wonders if he'd be any good as a farmer.</p>
