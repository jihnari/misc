# misc
probably going to use this to host misc resource files. 

# note
this code is not intended for public consumption (except if featured in a tutorial). it is messy, incomplete, and unsupported. if you do use anything from this repository, i request that you create/procure and host your own image files. a lot of these images were drawn by hand, and like... get ur own, man.
